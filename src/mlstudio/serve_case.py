r"""serve_case.py - example.

A FastAPI service that loads
a trained penguin species classifier
and exposes a /predict endpoint.

Author: Denise Case
Date: 2026-06

Process:
    - Load a saved model from artifacts/.
    - Accept a POST request with penguin measurements.
    - Return the predicted species.

Data Source:
    - artifacts/model.joblib (trained in the notebook or app_case.py)

Terminal commands to run this service from the root project folder:

uv run fastapi dev src/mlstudio/serve_case.py      # development (auto-reload)
uv run fastapi run src/mlstudio/serve_case.py      # production

- OR -

uv run uvicorn mlstudio.serve_case:app --reload    # development (auto-reload)
uv run uvicorn mlstudio.serve_case:app             # production

Then send a request - open a new terminal and run

If macOS or Linux, use \ line continuation characters:

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'

If Windows (PowerShell), use ` instead of \ for line continuation:

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict `
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
         -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'
OBS:
  Don't edit this file - it should remain a working example.
  Copy it, rename it, and modify your copy if you want to experiment.
  Include your command to run it in the docstring and in README.md.
