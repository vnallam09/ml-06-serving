> Professional Python project: deploying and serving machine learning models.

## Publishing Predictive Engines

A machine learning model learns patterns from data.
But, once trained, the model might just sit on a single computer.

**Serving** a model means wrapping it in a small web service
so anyone can send it a data request over the internet
and get a prediction back.

In this project, we train a model that
identifies penguin species from physical measurements,
then deploy it so you can ask it
**what is the most likely penguin species**
(given the measurements you provided in the request)
from anywhere in the world.

## Project Description

This project focuses on learning to deploy a trained model so others can use it.

We learn to:

- save and load a trained model
- wrap a model in a simple API or script
- validate inputs and handle errors gracefully
- think about drift, versioning, and monitoring

## Project Dependencies

This project needs additional dependencies

```toml
    "fastapi[standard]", # for serving - a web framework for building APIs
    "uvicorn",           # for serving - ASGI server for FastAPI
    "joblib",            # for model serialization (saving and loading models)
```

## Project Process

A `.joblib` file is a serialized Python object that holds
the trained model frozen to disk.

The package `joblib` converts the in-memory **RandomForestClassifier**
(with all its learned decision trees and their weights)
into bytes and writes them to a file.

Loading it back gives us the same trained model
without having to retrain.

This is how serving a trained model works:
train once, save once, load once at startup,
then predict on every incoming request.

## Example Notebook + Your Notebook

Keep the example notebook as it is.
Either copy it or use it to build a new notebook that ends in \_yourname.
See [docs/your-files.md](docs/your-files.md) for more.

Links:

- [ml_06_case.ipynb](notebooks/ml_06_case.ipynb)

## Working Files

You'll work with these areas:

- **data/raw** - raw data for exploration (only if you add a dataset)
- **docs/** - project narrative and documentation
- **src/mlstudio/** - the app is an example; run only (no need to modify)
- **notebooks/** - interactive analysis
- **pyproject.toml** - update authorship & links
- **zensical.toml** - update authorship & links

## Instructions (pro-analytics-02)

Follow the
[step-by-step workflow guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/workflow-b-apply-example-project/)
to complete:

1. Phase 1. **Start & Run**
2. Phase 2. **Change Authorship**
3. Phase 3. **Read & Understand**
4. Phase 4. **Modify**
5. Phase 5. **Apply**

## Challenges

Challenges are expected.
Sometimes instructions may not quite match your operating system.
When issues occur, share screenshots, error messages, and details about what you tried.
Working through issues is part of implementing professional projects.

## Success

After completing Phase 1. **Start & Run**, you'll have your own GitHub project,
with the example notebook executed and committed,
and running the example module will print out:

```shell
========================
Executed successfully!
========================
```

A new file `project.log` will appear in the root project folder.

</details>

## Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.
- You do not need to add to or modify `tests/`. They are provided for example only.
- Many files are silent helpers. Explore as you like, but nothing is required.
- You do NOT need to understand everything; understanding builds naturally over time.

## Troubleshooting >>>

If you see something like this in your terminal: `>>>` or `...`
You accidentally started Python interactive mode.
It happens.
Press `Ctrl+c` (both keys together) or `Ctrl+Z` then `Enter` on Windows.

## Terminal 2: Right-click and Rename "server"

Open a second terminal. Right-click to rename this terminal "server".

Run:

```shell
# Task 2. Start the example server
uv run fastapi dev src/mlstudio/serve_case.py
```

Keep this terminal open.
You should see the following which
means it is ready to receive requests:

## Terminal 3: Right-click and Rename "client"

Open a third terminal.
Right-click and rename it "client".

Use this terminal to **send a request** to the server.

We are making a request to the "/predict" endpoint.

Provide information about a penguin and ask
for the predicted species.

Line continuation characters for long commands are different by operating system.

- PowerShell uses a backtick.
- Bash and zsh use a back slash

The `curl` command means "check url".

- X defines the type of request
- H provides the requested response format (json data)
- d provides a json object (a penguin where we want to get the species)

### Windows PowerShell

```shell
# Task 3. Send a request to the server

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'
```

### macOS / Linux

```shell
# Task 3. Send a request to the server

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'
```

Should return the predicted result as JSON data:

```json
{ "prediction": "Adelie" }
```

Try sending some slightly different data - does it change the prediction?
Study the data.
Try to create a request that will answer with each of three different species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo)

## Try a Web-based ML Penguin Predictor on Render

Render hosts your ML model for free.
It is easy to set up, but they require a credit card (even for the free options).
The machines sleep so it can take a minute to wake up and answer.
See the docs/ for more.

Customize the request to see what species is predicted:

```shell
# PowerShell
curl -X POST https://ml-penguin-predictor.onrender.com/predict `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'

# macOS / Linux
curl -X POST https://ml-penguin-predictor.onrender.com/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'
```

## Try a Web-based ML Penguin Predictor on HuggingFace

HuggingFace also hosts your ML model for free.
It is a bit harder to set up (they use their own repo and we upload files via the browser).
No credit card is required.
See the docs/ for more.

Customize the request to see what species is predicted:

```shell
# PowerShell
curl -X POST https://denisecase-ml-penguin-predictor.hf.space/predict `
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'

# macOS / Linux
curl -X POST https://denisecase-ml-penguin-predictor.hf.space/predict \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"bill_length_mm": 39.1, "bill_depth_mm": 18.7, "flipper_length_mm": 181, "body_mass_g": 3750}'
```

## Findings and Visuals

Take screenshots of your charts and provide them here with a discussion.
In Markdown, display a figure by using:
an exclamation mark immediately followed by square brackets containing a useful caption
immediately followed by parentheses containing the relative path to your figure.
Note: When you start typing the path with a dot (.) for "here, in this directory",
the IDE may help complete the path.

In your custom project, follow this example, but

- your figures and narrative should reflect your work,
- this `README.md` should include your commands, process, and visuals, and
- `docs/index.md` should include your narrative.

Remove unnecessary instructional comments in your custom files.

Update figures to present interesting results from your custom project:
